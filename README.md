How users can get started with the project
To get started with this project, users should first clone or download the repository from Github. Once the repository has been downloaded, they can access the various files and models that were used in the project. For Rmd files, users can simply open them on Github. For pkl files, which contain machine learning models, users will need to read them into Python software. For ipynb files, it is recommended to use Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3) to load and open them.

What the project does
The project involves the modelling and validation of machine learning models for medical disputes. The following files were used for specific tasks:
